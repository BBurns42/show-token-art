# Show Token Art
This is a module for FoundryVTT that allows players and game masters to see token art upon hitting a custom keybinding.

By default, this keybind is shift + I for the token art and shift + O for the avatar art, and will display art for any selected and targeted tokens when the corresponding keybind is pressed.
